        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          ChadScript exists as a programming language built to solve hard
          problems in a simple way without sacrificing speed, control, or safety.
          It effectively functions like a simple Rust, or a systems programming
          Go.
        </p>
        <h3>Simplicity</h3>
        <p>
          Most symbols have been removed and the syntax has been decreased to
          a small set of operations. Additionally, generics are just a place
          holder for any type. Object Oriented Programming concepts have been
          removed in place of procedural code.
        </p>
        <h3>Processing Speed</h3>
        <p>
          Chadscript compiles to C code giving it all of the optimizations the
          C ecosystem enjoys such as inlining functions and constant evaluation.

        </p>

        <h3>Memory Speed</h3>
        <p>
          Chadscript uses an arena based memory model
          that functions like a garbage collected with predicatable behaviour
          and almost no overhead.
        </p>

        <h3>Safety</h3>
        <p>
          ChadScript without using pointers is completly memory safe (assuming
          no bugs). Every problem can be solved with just the built-in primatives
          which will check for out of bounds accesses and does not allow for
          double free. Work on thread safety is still in progress and has not
          been finalized but eventually it will be thread safe as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Freedom</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, ChadScript aims to get out of the way of programmers as much
          as possible. It allows for pointers and C ffi calls to allow programmers
          to decide when something that could break the program is warrented or not.
        </p>

      <section id="quick-start">
        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
        <h3>Requirments</h3>
        <p>
          Chadscript has some dependencies to work properly. Additionally, only x64 linux
          is supported although there is work to port to other platforms.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.nasm.us/">nasm</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Building the Compiler</h3>
        <pre><code>
  git clone git@github.com:qwed81/chadscript.git
  cd chadscript
  mkdir build
  npm run build
        </code></pre>

        <p>It is also useful to create an alias to save time</p>
        <pre><code>
  alias chad=node $PATH_TO_CHADSCRIPT/chad/index.js
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Project Setup</h3>
        <p>There are plans to automate creating a project once buildscripts are implemented</p>
        <pre><code>
  mkdir project
  cd project
  mkdir build
  mkdir lib
  mkdir src
  cp -r $PATH_TO_CHADSCRIPT/lib ./lib
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Run Project</h3>
        <p>First create the file src/main.chad</p>
        <pre><code>
  fn main() void!
    print("hello world")
    return Ok
        </code></pre>
        <p>Then run the compiler and execute the binary</p>
        <pre><code>
  chad &amp&amp ./build/output
        </code></pre>
      </section>

      <section id="guide">
        <h2>Guide</h2>
        <h3>Requirments</h3>
        <p>This document assumes moderate profeciency in any popular programming language</p>
        <ul>
          <li>C</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          Additionally, knowledge of 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">static types</a>
          and their usage in programming is required
        </p>
        <h3>Syntax Overview</h3>
        ChadScript aims to minimize typing. Excessive symbols make the language
        hard to type, hard to read, and hard to remember. There is no semi-colon
        to end the statements, there is no colon to mark the next block, and
        all control flow is determined by whitespace. Additionally, in the
        python spirit, '#' is the symbol for a comment
        <pre><code>
  fn main() void! # entry point of the program
    int a = 0 # declare a variable 'a' with type of int set to 0
    print(a) # call the function 'core.print' with value in 'a'
    return Ok # the program exits without error
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Primitive Types</h3>
        <pre><code>
  int a = 0 # 64 bit signed integer
  num b = 0.0 # 64 bit signed floating point
  char c = '@' # an 8 bit integer representing a character
  byte d = byte(10) # an 8 bit unsigned integer representing 1 byte
  bool e = true # a 'true' or 'false' value
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Memory Types</h3>
        <p>
          Chadscript has a couple of different types to deal with memory. Pointers
          represent a memory address and have no other constraints making them unsafe
          but useful in data structure implementations or when calling C functions.
          It is reccomended to not use them unless required because of easy to introduce
          bugs and security issues.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  int a = 0
  ptr[int] aPtr = ptr(a) # memory address of 'a'
  assert a == aPtr[0] # deref the pointer
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Data Structures</h3>

        <p>
          Data structures in Chadscript manage their own memory and will be
          deallocated or moved so that there is never any invalid memory accesses
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  str myString = "hello" # immutable array of characters
  print(myString[0]) # print 'h'
  print(myString.len) # print '5'
        </code></pre>

        <p>String Buffers (strbuf) is a mutable datastructure used to create strings</p>
        <pre><code>
  strbuf myString = strbuf("hello")
  myString[0] = 'y'
  myString += 'w'
  print(myString) # prints "yellow"
  str myStringReference = str(myString) # turns into immutable str
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Arrays function as resizable allocations, and slices similar to
          an 'ArrayList' in java or a 'List' in python
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  arr[int] myArr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  myArr += [5, 6, 7]
  myArr += 8
  myArr[0] = -100
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Structs and Generics</h3>
        <p>
          Structs are just groups of variables. As opposed to Java, C#, Python,
          or JavaScript structs are copied by value. In fact the behave exactly
          as C structs becuase they are compiled to C structs. However, structs
          support some higher level functionallity such as generics
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  struct Point
    int x
    int y

  fn point(int x, int y) Point
    return { x = x, y = y } 

  fn distSquared(Point p1, Point p2)
    int xDist = p2.x - p1.x
    int yDist = p2.y - p2.y
    return xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Generics</h3>

        <p>Generics in Chadscript are a single capital letter and represent any type</p>
        <pre><code>
  struct Pair[T]
    T first
    T second

  fn pair(T first, T second)
    return { first = first, second = second }

  fn doSomething() Pair[int]
    return pair(1, 2)
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Enums, Optionals, and Error Handling</h3>
        <p>
          It is common for new programming languages to have tagged unions.
          Effectively a value can be in 1 state at a type with multiple different
          types. This is very useful for message passing and variables that
          could be returned as different types. In Chadscript you can use the
          fields just like a struct, however you must prove that the field
          you are using is actually correct. This is done with the 'is' keyword.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  enum WorkMessage
    void Init
    int ChangeWorkload
    void Close

  fn main() void!
    WorkMessage msg = Init
    sendMessage(msg)
    sendMessage(ChangeWorkload(30))
    sendMessage(Close)

  fn processMessage(WorkMessage message)
    if message is Init
      print("init")
    elif message is ChangeWorkload
      int amt = message.ChangeWorkload
      print("change workload to {amt}")
    else
      print("close")
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          This construct is also useful for representing errors and
          optional values. In fact, this is what Chadscript does with
          additional syntax sugar. It means that there are no exceptions
          as well as no null values. This alone gets rid of most simple bugs
        </p>
        <pre><code>
  int? a = None
  if a is Some
    print(a.Some)
  if a is Some
    print(a) # sugar to just use the value only if a is Some

  # additionally values van be set using the syntax sugar
  a = Some(10)
  a = 10
        </code></pre>

        <p>errors act in the same way except have a couple more properties</p>
        <pre><code>
  int! b = 0 # declare a result (Err or Ok)
  int c = try a # if it is Err then return Err, otherwise assign C to a.Some

  # if a should never be an err,
  # if a is an err then crash the program and give debug info
  int d = assert a 
        </code></pre>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Functions exist in the top level scope of the program. All parameters
          in functions are pass by reference and are immutable by default. Parameters
          can be specified as 'mut' to have changes to them affect the calling
          function's variables.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  fn entry()
    int a = 0
    changeA(a)
    print(a) # prints 10

  fn changeA(mut int a)
    a = 10
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          Functions also can be overloaded based on parameter and return types.
          This doesn't cause problems that other languages have because all types
          are manually typed out so the compiler does not need to figure out the
          type. This is very useful in creating easy to read and use APIs. 
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  fn foo()
    int integer = input()
    num number = input()

  fn input() int
    print("input integer: ")
    return 0

  fn input() num
    print("input number: ")
    return 0.0
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Default Paramaters</h3>
        <p>
          Default parameters exist to handle the outlier cases to make
          the api simpler for most use cases. It can also be used
          to provide an API where functionallity based on type is
          automatic but can be changed in exception. This is useful
          for things like hash functions, comparison of integers, in
          ordered data structures, and even mocking as mock functions
          can be passed in instead of full mocked classes.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  fn myPrint(T val, str(T) implStr=str)
    str thisStr = implStr(val) # get the string for 'val'
    C.printf(cstr("%s\n"), cstr(terminated)) # call the C function printf
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This example is function that takes in a default parameter of a function
          named 'str'. This will find a function that matches the type
          signature. ex: myPrint(10) will use str(int) str fucnction
          this can be used to implement 'trait bounds' because this function
          can only be called if given an implementation of str that matches
          the function type. Also a function can be provided for mocking
          purposes or for special cases
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  # the -1 position means read from the last position in the file
  fn read(mut File file, mut arr[byte] buf, int position=-1) int! amtRead
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Trivial Async</h3>
        <p>
          In ChadScript async is not thought of in the same way as other
          languages. It is most similar to go but not exactly.
          There is no Built In language features to support async but
          the standard IO libraries all will yield execution to another
          running function instead of blocking. The standard library also
          supports both green threads in the form of greenFns (a function
          running inside a worker pool that is optimized to perform IO.
          Think of handling a Http Request). It also supports standard
          OS threads that will block on IO operations and is optimized
          for high compute applications.
        </p>

        <h3>Controlling Memory</h3>
        <p>
          Dynamic memory (memory without a fixed size) is by default allocated on
          a stack of bump allocators. Fixed size memory is still allocated on the stack.
          When new memory is needed for a data structure  
          it will request it from whatever bump allocator
          is on top of the stack. All of the memory will be freed once the allocator
          is poped off the top of the stack. Remaining dynamic structures will be
          allocated on the next bump allocator in the stack. This allows for a
          almost zero cost garbage collector that allows for fine grain control of memory
          where needed. The downside is the library maintainers need to think of the lifetime
          per algorithm. A game loop or a web request should free the memory once completed.
        </p>

        <pre><code>
  fn main() void!
    arr[int] a = [1, 2, 3, 4] # will live until main exits

    # once this scope exits a will be copied to the outer arena
    # because it was modified and outlives the scope. s will be
    # freed automatically
    arena
      a = [3, 4, 5] # allocate on new arena
      strbuf s = strbuf("hello world")

    return Ok
        </code></pre>
