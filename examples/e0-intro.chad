ChadScript is a compiled programming language made to give fine grain
control to the programmer, without destorying their productivity.

These examples assume you have programmed before and only go in to
depth on uncommon or specific knowledge.

ensure the compiler is installed by running 'chad examples/e0-intro.chad'
run the binary that is placed in build/output

fn main()
  print("hello world")
