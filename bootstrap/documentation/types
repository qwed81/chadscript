type checking:
type checking is done post parsing

built in types include
int (i64)
bool
range

i8-i64
u8-u64

# the not mutable and mutable versions
# of a slice into an array or list. 
view[T]
slice[T]

T?
T!
errcode

# functions such as push and allocations are implemented
# in the std rather than the core library
list[T]
str

# automatic conversions
list -> slice
str -> view
slice -> view

# functions can be used with format string easliy
str s = str(f"let {a} = 24")
print(f"let {b} = 24")

each statement needs to be recursively checked
each expression needs to be recusively checked

this ensures that the program is actually valid
